Project Overview

The GAMS project aims to optimize a portfolio of proposed projects based on various criteria, including knowledge requirements, resource availability, and time constraints. The project is divided into four main files: File1.gms, File2.gms, File3.gms, and File4.gms.
File1.gms - Knowledge and Resource Data

This file initializes the knowledge and resource data required for the project. It defines sets, aliases, tables, and parameters related to knowledge requirements, project activities, and resource constraints.
Sets

    a: Proposed projects
    k: Knowledge areas
    i: Single time period
    j: Time periods

Parameters

    WI(i, k, a): Resource requirement for implementing project a in time period i
    DI(j, k, a): Time required to complete activity i for project a in time period j
    Various parameters for setting priorities and penalties

File2.gms - Normalization and Calculation

This file normalizes the knowledge and resource parameters to facilitate further calculations. It computes the width and depth of knowledge, variability ranges, and knowledge importance.
File3.gms - Portfolio Selection

This file determines the optimal portfolio selection based on the normalized data, incorporating width and depth of knowledge, variability ranges, and other constraints.
Parameters

    w(a): Binary variable for project selection
    x(i, j): Binary variable for activity start
    y(i, j, s): Binary variable for activity occurrence under scenario s

Equations

    ObjectiveFunction: Objective function to be minimized
    Various constraints related to project selection, incompatibility, and prerequisites

File4.gms - Documentation and Results

This file provides documentation for the project and displays the final results.
Parameters

    Various parameters related to knowledge width, depth, variability, and importance

Display Statements

    Statements to display key parameters and results

Conclusion

This GAMS project aims to optimize the selection of proposed projects based on knowledge requirements, resource constraints, and time considerations. The files work together to normalize data, formulate an objective function, and display the final results.
