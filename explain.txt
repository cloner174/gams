In part 1:
The cardinality is simply showing how many i's we have, the normalizing factor is the fraction that we consider only to be sure that we have all the possible i's.
How many width index or 'i' do we have?? One piece

Then we come to solve it, what do we do?
Let's solve the fraction first
How many i's do we have? One piece
What is the maximum WIi'ka?? 9
How many k do we have 10
How many a's do we have: 5

So we have fifty fractions, the denominator of all of them is 9, and their faces are according to the table I gave you

That means we have 50 widthka
That is, the width of each knowledge k in each project a

The second stage is j
The procedure is exactly the same as the supply, but because we have 2 j, it is a little different

That cardinality is one
 
We solve the fraction for k and a, but since we have two j's, we add the two fractions
That is, for example, knowledge width 3 in project 4 becomes 1 with j=1 and becomes 10 with j=2
We have two deficits
These two must be combined

Finally, we have 50 depthka for the depth of each knowledge in each project

Arian, [2023-09-29 14:23]
The third and fourth steps are okay, we are creating a range of changes, there is no formula, we just want to get a point

Arian, [2023-09-29 14:31]
The fifth step is to multiply the k widths by the k depths

Arian, [2023-09-29 14:33]
In the third step, we get the total knowledge k in the organization
But since we don't have scientists, we don't have any interference unless we want to get involved, but it's simplified, interference/overlap
is not

Arian, [2023-09-29 14:42]
It is for 5 projects
Calculates the product of the width and depth of each k

Arian, [2023-09-29 14:46]
The last one is exactly like the previous one
His story
It is just collecting all the KIk for each knowledge

This will be our first episode
There are three more that are easier than this
